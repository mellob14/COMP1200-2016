=== Circuit design

. Let A and B be two 2-bit binary numbers (i.e., A1 A0 and B1 B0). Write out a truth table for A less than or equal to B. For example, 0b10 is less than or equal to 0b11, so the output for that row should be true.

. Write out the truth table for the minority circuit (it's true when the minority of X, Y, and Z are true).
. Write out the equivalent logic expression for the previous answer.

. Show c + (b * c)' = 1
. Show (a + c) * (a * d + a * d') + a * c + c = a + c
. Simplify a' * (a + b) + (b + a * a) * (a + b')
. Show (a' * b') + (a' * b) + (a * b') = (a * b)'

== Lab 2: Circuit implementation

Implement these circuits from lab 1 in three different ways:

. Window -> Combinational analysis
. 8-1 MUX
. ROM

The circuits:

. Let A and B be two 2-bit binary numbers (i.e., A1 A0 and B1 B0). Write out a truth table for A less than or equal to B. For example, 0b10 is less than or equal to 0b11, so the output for that row should be true.

. Minority circuit (it's true when the minority of inputs X, Y, and Z are true, or equivalently, most inputs are false).

Save your work in a file called `lab2.circ` in your `COMP1200-2016/Labs/` folder.

== Lab 3: State machine implementation

Implement a vending machine that accepts nickels, dimes and quarters.
It sells only one thing, but it's worth 25 cents.

The state-transition diagram (below) describes the vending machine.
Implicitly, the absence of additional coins implies that we remain in the same state.

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/COMP1200-2016/Labs/lab3.svg[Vending machine state transition diagram]

. Answer these questions about the state machine above.
.. List all possible inputs. How many do we have?
.. List all possible states. How many do we have?
.. The outputs are: vend and return money (0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 cents).
.. How many bits for state will you need?
.. How many input bits will you need?
. Assign states to bits, inputs to bits and outputs to bits.
. Write out a state-transition table.
. How many bits will we need for ROM address?
. How many bits will we need for ROM data?
. Finally, use a ROM to implement said thing.

The table may look like this:

[cols="5",format="csv"]
|===
state,input,next,vend,return
000,00,000,0,000
000,01,001,0,000

== Lab 4: Machine language programming

It's like CS1, all over again.

Write out source code for a function that computes the maximum of two numbers.
Yes, I know practically every language has a `max(a,b)` function,
but I want you to write your own version for the https://github.com/lawrancej/COMP1200-2016/blob/master/Circuits/cpu-16bit-isa.adoc[CPU I supplied].

----
int a = RAM[0x80]
int b = RAM[0x81]
int max = a;
if (b > a) {
    max = b;
}
----

1. Write out the equivalent assembly code for source code.
One stipulation: the two numbers should be loaded from RAM.
2. Write out equivalent machine code, and test it in Logisim,
using the supplied CPU in `Circuits/cpu-16bit.circ`.
3. Save the contents of RAM as lab4.txt.

== Lab 5: Control unit as ROM

Open `Circuits/cpu-16bit.circ` in Logisim.
Replace the bus control's contents with a ROM, but leave the multiplexer alone, as show below:

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/COMP2270-2015/labs/bus-control-rom.png[ROM replaces gates]

The ROM should have 5 input (address) bits (corresponding to clock, cycle and op's 3 MSBs), and 4 output (data) bits (corresponding to reg write, ALU enable, bus read, bus write).
We don't need the least significant bit of the opcode, because it does not influence the output in any way.

*Hint*: poke on inputs to see what the corresponding output is, and note that in the table below.
Then, take that table, and program (and connect) the ROM accordingly.

NOTE: There's no state involved, it's purely combinational.

IMPORTANT: Test your CPU to ensure that your code from the prior lab is still functional.
If not, you goofed up.

Save your work in a spreadsheet (and save the new Logisim CPU) and commit and push as usual.

== Lab 6: Project setup

Setup to duild a CPU in Logisim and test it with machine code.

The CPU should be programmable, but the data and program do not need to share the RAM.
That is, the program could be in a separate ROM (read only memory) to simplify things.

=== Speed dating

Goal: find a partner or partners.

Ideally, work in pairs.
Working on this individually is *very* challenging and not recommended.
Groups of 3 are okay, but larger groups are not recommended.

=== Repository setup

Goal: Set up your repository.

----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrancej/COMP1200Project/master/main.sh | bash
----

. Add each of your friend(s) as collaborators to your Github repository.
. Add your friend(s) SSH urls to git.

----
cd ~/COMP1200Project
git remote add somebody git@github.com:somebody/COMP1200Project.git
git fetch --all
----

=== Overview

Goal: Decide on the parameters of your http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit[CPU].

You may work on an existing CPU, including the one I supplied, but in that case,
you need to clearly explain what you did to improve it.
The best way to do this is to commit the existing CPU in your repository first
and explain that it is your starting point.

Example CPUs include:

* http://minnie.tuhs.org/Programs/UcodeCPU/index.html[UcodeCPU]
* http://minnie.tuhs.org/CompArch/Tutes/week03.html[Tutes]
* http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2445196.2445296&coll=DL&dl=ACM&CFID=725866919&CFTOKEN=92187912[Simple CPU]
* https://github.com/briandef/bf16[Brainfuck]

Answer these questions, but remember, you will need to write a demonstration program for this CPU.
The easier it is to implement the CPU, the harder it may be to write demonstration code.

==== Architecture

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instruction_set_architectures[What kind of architecture is it?]
Is this CPU a Harvard architecture or von Neumann architecture?

NOTE: A Harvard architecture CPU (where program is in ROM and data is in RAM) is
simpler to implement with few (if any) consequences on machine code complexity.

==== Instructions

Decide on an http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set[instruction set].

Examples:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8[CHIP-8]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck[Brainfuck]

The CPU *must* support at minimum: conditional jumps, arithmetic, logic, and loading and storing data to RAM.
Examples include: Brainfuck, http://www.bigmessowires.com/nibbler/[Nibbler], 6502, http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/[jvm]

* How many instructions do you plan to implement?
* What are they? (Keep in mind, some machines only implement a handful of instructions)
* What is the maximum number of operands an instruction may have? (Usually, this is no more than 3)
* How many bits will you use to encode each instruction?
* Are instructions a fixed width? (It is far easier for it to be fixed width, btw)

==== Registers

How wide are the registers? 8 bits? 16 bits? 32 bits?

How many registers do you plan to implement in the register file?
At a minimum, you will need a register to point to the current instruction (the program counter),
and a register to store the current instruction.
You will likely need a register to store the current microcode instruction and program counter.
In addition, you will need registers to store data.

Machines without a register file exist: they use stacks instead (see http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/about.html[JVM assembly]).
Obviously, a register is still necessary to keep track of where we are in the stack, but in a "stack machine" the register isn't referenced directly as an operand.
Instead, push and pop operations implicitly change the stack register.

Supporting multiple registers arguably simplifies machine coding, but large register files are tedious to implement.

==== Hints

Start with some existing CPU and modify it to work better in some meaningful way.

Example improvements:

Squeeze out instructions::
* Remove some existing instruction to make room for better ones

Modify instructions::
* Replace LOAD Rd with LOAD Rd, Ra: Rd = RAM[Ra]
* Split comparison from jump:
** CMPEQ Ra Rb (set a 1-bit test flag register to Ra == Rb)
** CMPLT Ra Rb (set a 1-bit test flag register to Ra < Rb)
** JMP imm (jump to immediate if test flag is set)

Memory-mapped I/O::
* Loading from a special memory address reads from the keyboard buffer
* Storing to a special memory address writes to the tty (screen)

Fix reset::
* Allow the reset button to also reset the phase of the CPU
